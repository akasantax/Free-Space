# Free-Space and Dynamic Object Detection
This repository contains files for:
* Free Space computation using occupancy grids.
* Detection of dynamic objects using a RANSAC based segmentation of key  points.
* Mapping of sequence of images from one occupancy grid to another.

Note: code is currently not clean and need to add a few things, to be updated soon.
